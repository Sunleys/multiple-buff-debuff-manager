# Multiple Buff & Debuff 

## Introduction 

### Generic examples of common buffs
- Ability Up:
  - Whether it's Strength, Speed, Defense, Magic, or other stats, this will grant the recipient of these spells a temporary flat increase to that stat, thus improving the results of all internal calculations derived from it (be it damage, healing, accuracy, or so on). In some games, this is an "official" buff that can be neutralized by a Status-Buff Dispel. In some games, there may be just one of these (usually for Attack), while in others, they may be absent, except for increasing levels of Agility Up/Down.
Many games that have the Ability Up buff will also have a corresponding Ability Down as the negative counterpart, and the two may cancel each other out.

- Reflect:
  - Causes spells or attacks to deflect off of the intended target and hit something else instead, usually a member of the opposite party. In some cases, this makes no distinction between friendly or hostile magic: If you cast Reflect on an opponent, any attempts by them to cast recovery spells or status buffs of their own may bounce onto you instead. Most spells will only reflect once before they strike the target.
  
- Haste:
  - Speeds up the character. This is distinct from a Speed buff as listed above: Whereas a Speed buff will improve internal calculations (say, accuracy and evasion) derived from one's Speed (and, depending on the game, may modify turn order), Haste actually multiplies the number of turns or actions the character is given during battle. In games featuring a "Slow" status effect, the two will usually cancel each other out.
  
- Regeneration: 
  - Slowly restores a character's HP. In turn-based games, it will heal a set amount of HP every turn. Although it's the polar opposite of Poison, it doesn't usually directly cancel poison out; rather, both effects go at the same time, which may or may not even out depending on the game.
  
- Charge / Focus: 
  - Increases the effect of the next attack or spell used. Many of these are self-used, effectively using two turns/actions for a single, stronger attack (which, depending on the game rules and opponent's defensive strength, can be more effective than two regular attacks).
  
- Protect:
  - Reduces damage taken, often by a specific source. Many games have variations on this for different types of damage (e.g. physical or magic), and some even going as far as having Protect spells against individual elements. A partial reflect may or may not be built in.

### Buff & Debuff applied in different videogames / games 

#### World of Warcraft ([official website](https://worldofwarcraft.com/es-es/))
Priests in World of Warcraft provide many, including resurrection. Most spellcasters have at least one buff spell.
Even Warriors and Rogues have some buff effects, although those are largely self-targeting abilities.
Druids are also notable for having no less than 3 types of Regeneration buffs. A normal one, one with an instant effect at the beginning, and one with an instant effect when it expires.

#### Warcraft III ([official website](http://eu.blizzard.com/es-es/games/war3/))
Many unit types in Warcraft III, especially the unique hero units, have buffs and auras that aid their subordinates in battle.

#### Diablo II ([official website](http://eu.blizzard.com/es-es/games/d2/))
Paladins in Diablo II were a lackluster fighter class at high levels, but were valued for their auras and healing abilities. This was later changed, while paladin auras were still beneficial to their parties, paladins are able to be extremely effective in melee (zealots and smiters, which is one of the best builds for killing the hardest bosses) and as casters (hammerdins, a very popular build for rushing, power leveling, and farming) in their own right.

#### Minecraft ([official website](https://minecraft.net/es-es/))
Minecraft has several status buffs that are obtained from potions and using beacons. The stronger the buff, the more potent it is and they can be used on friends and foes alike:</br>
. _Regeneration_: Restores health over time.</br>
. _Speed Boost_: Walk and run faster. </br>
. _Strength_: Damage output is boosted. </br>
. _Resistance_: Increased defense. </br>
. _Fire Resistance_: Immunity to fire and lava. </br>
. _Night Vision_: All dark areas are lit up, though they are not actually filled with light, thus monsters can still spawn. </br>
. _Water Breathing_: Super Not-Drowning Skills plus improved vision underwater.</br>
. _Invisibility_: Exactly What It Says on the Tin, except for items carried and armor pieces worn.</br>
. _Haste_: Mine blocks faster.</br>
. _Health Boost_: Temporarily increases your maximum health.</br>
